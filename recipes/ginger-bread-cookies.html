        <p>When baking cookies please remember to mold a face, in case they must scream.</p>

        <p>Of course, we don't expect for your cookies to develop measurable sentience
            with this recipe, but the odds are never zero. It is always better to be prepared.</p>

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup light molasses</li>
                <li>1 cup butter</li>
                <li>1 tbsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tbsp ground ginger</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground cloves</li>
                <li>4 to 4.5 cups all-purpose flour, more for rolling dough</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Directions</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar, molasses, and butter.
                    Place over medium-low heat and stir just until mixture is melted
                    and smooth. Remove from heat and mix in baking soda and 1/4 cup
                    cold water/ Set aside and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>

                <li>Add egg, salt, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves; stir
                    to mix well. Add 4 cups flour and mix well, adding up to 1/2 cup
                    more if dough seems sticky. Shape into a ball, cover and refrigerate
                    for at least 2 hours, up to 24 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment paper
                    and set aside. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-inch
                    thickness, and cut into gingerbread person shapes with a 5-inch-long
                    cookie cutter. Arrange on baking sheets 1.5 inches apart, and bake until
                    risen and no longer shiny (about 7 minutes). Remove from heat and 
                    allow cookies to cool.</li>
            </ol>
